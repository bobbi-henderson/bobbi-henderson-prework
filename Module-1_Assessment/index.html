                    Hello, my name is Bobbi, and I am single and ready to mingle!... Just kidding,
                    this isn't that kind of about me section. I am a young professional who is looking 
                    to broaden my horizons and learn new skills. I have always had a passion for learning, 
                    and ever since graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2015, I have been seeking
                    out self-lead learning opportunities. Currently, I am focusing my efforts on 
                    learning the art of coding. I have been learning to code in my free time over the last 
                    eight months or so, and I have been really enjoying the journey. While most of my 
                    professional experience has been in Customer Service, I have found that learning 
                    to code has allowed me to apply the problem-solving skills I have gained over 
                    my career in a more analytical way. I am very excited about the possibility to change 
                    careers into software development, and I welcome the constant learning that comes with 
                    entering the field.

                    Aside from my passion of learning new things, some of my other hobbies include reading, 
                    watching movies, going to concerts, traveling, and listening to podcasts. Due to the 
                    current COVID-19 pandemic I am definitely missing some of my favorite hobbies, 
                    like frequenting movie theaters, concerts, and traveling as much as I can. I have been trying
                    to focus that time into the things I still can do. I have added multiple new podcasts into my
                    regular rotation, and I have been able to read a lot more as well. I just finished reading 
                    "All Systems Red" the first book in <em>The Murderbot Diaries</em> by Martha Wells. It is honestly
                    one of the best books I have read in recent memory, and I am eager to continue with the rest of the
                    series. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves Science Fiction, or to someone who is 
                    looking for a good place to start in the genre.

                I also want to give a quick shoutout to my Minnesotan roots! Even though I spent some time living in the 
                great state of Florida, I found my way back to Minnesota after only two years because Minnesota is awesome!
                I recommend moving to Minnesota for anyone who is looking to relocate. Don't let the snow scare you off,
                we have some of the nicest people you will ever meet, and the summers are second to none! Lastly, Go Wild!
